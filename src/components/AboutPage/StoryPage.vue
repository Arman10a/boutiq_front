    </div>
    <h3 class="text-lg">Boutiq evolved from the passion project of married co-founders Rena Pacheco-Theard and Dan Driscoll, who are longtime Airbnb Plus Superhosts and Vrbo Premier Partners and veterans of the technology, travel, and "PropTech" sectors.</h3>
    <h3 class="text-lg">Convinced that first-class hospitality could be combined with data science to deliver exceptional guest experiences and market-leading returns to vacation rental homeowners, they created algorithms that allowed them to dynamically price vacation homes for short-term rental purposes, as well as to forecast the rental earning potential of homes listed as STRs across the country.</h3>
    <h3 class="text-lg">We call it "The Boutiq Method" ðŸª¶</h3>
