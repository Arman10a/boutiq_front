      <h3>
        At Boutiq, we like to say that we put the vacation back in "vacation home," and the passive back in "passive income." Our goal is to make it easy and effortless to invest in high-yield, luxury vacation rental properties, whether you are a first-time buyer or an experienced real estate investor.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Boutiq's unique, white-glove process is your full-service concierge for finding, purchasing, and renting the perfect vacation rental home for your investment and personal use goals. Luxury vacation rental home buyers and investors trust the Boutiq Homes team to identify which markets and the homes therein will earn the best rental returns and be the best fit for each buyer's needs, whether that includes personal use as a second home or if the asset purchase is intended purely for investment purposes.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Working with Boutiq is truly an end-to-end experience. Guiding buyers to discover and purchase the best vacation rental homes for their search criteria, usage goals, and budget, is only the beginning. When a home goes under contract, Boutiq's team of hospitality and rental operations experts works swiftly with our professional design partners to design and furnish the home's interior and exterior, as well as providing guidance on renovations and other upgrades that will ensure each property in Boutiq's luxury vacation rental portfolio delivers exceptional rental yields to its owners. And we are just as obsessive about protecting Boutiq's portfolio of homes against wear and tear.
