      <h3 class="text-lg">Whether you are a seasoned real estate investor or a newcomer looking to put your money to work with a high-yield rental property, Boutiq has you covered.</h3>
      <h3 class="text-lg">It's no secret that short-term rentals are an exciting new real estate investment opportunity, but of course with "hot opportunities" there is also much risk and speculation. Work with Boutiq to separate the wheat from the chaff. We facilitate the entire process from purchase to onboarding to management. Our proprietary rental potential forecasting tools apply forward-looking machine learning (ML) to see where the puck is going, rather than to rely on historical data and neighborhood comps. We also assess hidden risk elements, from climate change factors to regulatory changes that can derail an otherwise appealing investment opportunity.</h3>
      <h3 class="text-lg">And best of all, Boutiq manages the entire rental operation. We're more than just a vacation rental "guide," we are your end-to-end partner that is obsessed with making each vacation rental investment a brilliant success.</h3>
